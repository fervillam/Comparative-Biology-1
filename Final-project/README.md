# Testing reconstructed ancestral area sensibility to changes in branch lengths 
Here I test test the if ancestral area reconstruction is sensible to changes in branch lengths using all possible combinations of a 4 branched topology: 2x2 and 3x1 with equal BL (Boysu Lovū -just kidding, it's Branch Length, of course-) of 1. Those reference topologies are available in Final-project/Reference-Topologies

The main script is labeled "Boys-Love.sh". As you may see, is a bash file. Please, make sure to download all files and change the file directory prior to running it. My personal suggestion is to create a folder called "Ancestral-BoysLove-Project" within Documents so you don't have to make any changes. *However, this only works if you are currently on Linux, otherwise, please change the file directory.*
