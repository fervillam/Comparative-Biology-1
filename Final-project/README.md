# Testing reconstructed ancestral area sensibility to changes in branch lengths
Here I test test the if ancestral area reconstruction is sensible to changes in branch lengths using all possible combinations of a 4 branched topology: 2x2 and 3x1 with equal BL (Boysu LovÅ«) of 1. Those reference topologies are available in Final-project/Data/Reference-Topologies

Given the mentioned topologies, all combinations of 2 possible ancestral areas were asignated to terminals: *aaab* and *aabb
