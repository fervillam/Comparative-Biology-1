# Testing reconstructed ancestral area sensibility to changes in branch lengths 
Here I test test the if ancestral area reconstruction is sensible to changes in branch lengths using all possible combinations of a 4 branched topology: 2x2 and 3x1 with equal BL (Boysu Lovū -just kidding, it's Branch Length, of course-) of 1. Those reference topologies are available in Final-project/Reference-Topologies

Given the mentioned topologies, all combinations of 2 possible ancestral areas were asignated to terminals: *aaab* and *aabb*. 3x1 topology will also have *aaba* area distribution.

The main script is labeled "Boys-Love.sh". As you may see, is a bash file. Please, make sure to download all files and change the file directory prior to the run. My personal suggestion is to create a folder called "Ancestral-Project" within Documents so you don't have to make any changes. However, *this only works if you are currently on Linux*, otherwise, please change the file directory.
